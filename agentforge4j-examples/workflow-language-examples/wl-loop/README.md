# Loop

## What this teaches

How the workflow language expresses bounded iteration through a looped blueprint, and how the
termination strategy decides when the loop stops. Two variants are shown side by side: a fixed-count
loop and an agent-signalled loop. The example is LLM-agnostic: it runs offline against a deterministic
fake by default; pointing it at a real provider needs a provider module, credentials, and the agent
repointed away from the fake — no change to the workflow structure itself. No Spring, no network on
the default path.

## AgentForge4j capability demonstrated

A looped blueprint: a workflow includes a `BLUEPRINT_REF`, and the referenced blueprint's
`behaviour.loopConfig` makes its body repeat. Two `terminationStrategy` values:

- **`FIXED_COUNT`** (`wl-loop-fixed`) — the body runs exactly `maxIterations` times; any agent
  completion signal is ignored.
- **`AGENT_SIGNAL`** (`wl-loop-signal`) — the body runs until the agent emits a `COMPLETE` signal,
  bounded by `maxIterations`. Here the agent signals on its first iteration, so the loop stops at one
  iteration, well before the ceiling — the agent, not a fixed count, decides when to stop. The
  `maxIterations: 5` on this loop is a safety bound that is never reached here; had the agent never
  signalled, the loop would stop at that ceiling and `FAIL` (its `maxIterationsAction`).

Iteration counts are read by tallying `LOOP_ITERATION_STARTED` events rather than inferred, so the
contrast between the two strategies is asserted directly. The event log is reached through
`components().workflowEventLog()` — the internal integrator accessor, not part of the public API; an
embedding application would normally surface run progress through its own projection.

## How to run

From the examples root (`agentforge4j-examples/`), after installing the framework into your local
`.m2` (`./mvnw install -DskipTests` in the OSS reactor):

```bash
./mvnw -pl workflow-language-examples/wl-loop -am verify
```

`verify` runs the deterministic tests, which always use the bundled fake and assert each loop's
iteration count and completion.

**Offline (default).** `WlLoopApp.main` runs with no configuration: the `api-key` in
`src/main/resources/example.properties` is blank, so the deterministic `agentforge4j-llm-fake` provider
serves the loop body's agent calls — no key, no network, no extra dependency. Run it from your IDE to
watch both loops print.

**Against a real LLM.** Set a provider key — either `agentforge4j.example.llm.api-key` in
`example.properties`, or the `AGENTFORGE4J_EXAMPLE_LLM_API_KEY` environment variable (see `.env.example`)
— add a provider module dependency (for example `agentforge4j-llm-openai`) to this module's `pom.xml`,
and edit the `providerPreferences` in `src/main/resources/agents/loop-agent.agent/agent.json` to name
the chosen provider instead of `fake` (the agent ships pinned to the fake provider so the offline
default is deterministic). With those three changes made, the same workflow structure runs unchanged,
with the loop body served by the real model — so the agent-signal loop stops whenever the real model
emits `COMPLETE`, which may take a different number of iterations than the scripted fake. With a key set
but no provider module on the classpath, assembly fails fast with a clear "no provider factory" message;
with the module present but the agent still pinned to `fake`, the run fails at the first agent step with
an `LlmInvocationException` saying the agent has no available provider preferences. Precedence for
every value is system property, then environment variable, then `example.properties`.

## Expected behaviour / output

On the offline fake path, `main` runs both loops and prints, for example:

```text
wl-loop-fixed -> status=COMPLETED, iterations=3
wl-loop-signal -> status=COMPLETED, iterations=1
```

The bundled tests assert exactly 3 iterations for the fixed-count loop and exactly 1 for the
agent-signal loop, both reaching `COMPLETED`, deterministically against the fake.

1. `src/main/resources/workflows/wl-loop-fixed.workflow/fixed-body.blueprint.json` — the
   `FIXED_COUNT` `loopConfig` on the blueprint behaviour.
2. `src/main/resources/workflows/wl-loop-signal.workflow/signal-body.blueprint.json` — the
   `AGENT_SIGNAL` `loopConfig`.
3. `src/main/java/.../WlLoopApp.java` — runs both loops and reads iteration counts from the event log,
   resolving fake vs. real.
4. `src/main/java/.../WlLoopFakeLlm.java` — the single source of truth for the offline scripted
   per-iteration responses.
5. `src/main/java/.../ExampleLlmConfig.java` — how the fake/real toggle, provider, and key are resolved.
6. `src/test/java/.../WlLoopAppTest.java` — the deterministic iteration-count assertions.

# Human in the Loop

## What this teaches

How the workflow language expresses human-in-the-loop control: an `INPUT` step that suspends to
collect data from a person, and a `HUMAN_APPROVAL` gate that suspends for an approve/reject decision
— and the resume verbs that drive each forward. This is the workflow-language companion to
`framework-examples/human-approval`; that example covers the suspend/resume basics, this one focuses
on the language constructs and the resume-verb contract. The example is LLM-agnostic: it runs offline
against a deterministic fake by default, or against a real provider with no code change. No Spring, no
network on the default path.

## AgentForge4j capability demonstrated

`InputBehaviour` and the `HUMAN_APPROVAL` step gate. The run suspends at `AWAITING_INPUT`;
`WorkflowRuntime.submitInput(runId, answers, actorId)` supplies the artifact's fields (stored in the
context under `<artifactId>.<itemId>`). The reviewer agent then finishes its step (served by the LLM —
a scripted `COMPLETE` from `agentforge4j-llm-fake` offline, or a real model when configured) and the
run suspends at `AWAITING_STEP_APPROVAL`; `WorkflowRuntime.decideStepApproval(...)` decides: `Approve`
→ `COMPLETED`, `Reject` → `FAILED` (with a `StepRejectionFailure` carrying the reason). These two gates
use different resume verbs — `submitInput` for input, `decideStepApproval` for the approval — which is
the contract this example makes concrete.

## How to run

From the examples root (`agentforge4j-examples/`), after installing the framework into your local
`.m2` (`./mvnw install -DskipTests` in the OSS reactor):

```bash
./mvnw -pl workflow-language-examples/wl-human-in-the-loop -am verify
```

`verify` runs the deterministic tests, which always use the bundled fake and assert both suspends and
both terminal outcomes.

**Offline (default).** `WlHumanInTheLoopApp.main` runs with no configuration: the `api-key` in
`src/main/resources/example.properties` is blank, so the deterministic `agentforge4j-llm-fake` provider
serves the reviewer agent's step — no key, no network, no extra dependency. Run it from your IDE to
watch both paths print.

**Against a real LLM.** Set a provider key — either `agentforge4j.example.llm.api-key` in
`example.properties`, or the `AGENTFORGE4J_EXAMPLE_LLM_API_KEY` environment variable (see `.env.example`)
— **and** add a provider module dependency (for example `agentforge4j-llm-openai`) to this module's
`pom.xml`. No code changes: the same workflow and agents run, with the reviewer agent's step now served
by the real model. The input and the approval decision are still supplied in code — they are human
gates, not model output. With a key set but no provider module on the classpath, the run fails fast with
a clear "no provider factory" message. Precedence for every value is system property, then environment
variable, then `example.properties`.

## Expected behaviour / output

On the offline fake path, `main` runs the approve and reject paths and prints, for example:

```text
approve — after start: AWAITING_INPUT
approve — after input: AWAITING_STEP_APPROVAL
approve — after approve: COMPLETED
reject — after reject: FAILED
  failure reason: Needs rework
```

The bundled tests assert the `AWAITING_INPUT` → `AWAITING_STEP_APPROVAL` → terminal sequence, the
stored input value, and the `StepRejectionFailure` on reject — all deterministically against the fake.

## Files to read first

1. `src/main/resources/workflows/wl-human-in-the-loop.workflow/workflow.json` — the `INPUT` step and
   the agent step gated by `HUMAN_APPROVAL`.
2. `src/main/resources/workflows/wl-human-in-the-loop.workflow/request-form.artifact.json` — the
   input artifact whose fields `submitInput` supplies.
3. `src/main/java/.../WlHumanInTheLoopApp.java` — the start → submit input → decide approval flow
   for both outcomes, resolving fake vs. real.
4. `src/main/java/.../WlHumanInTheLoopFakeLlm.java` — the single source of truth for the offline
   scripted reviewer response.
5. `src/main/java/.../ExampleLlmConfig.java` — how the fake/real toggle, provider, and key are resolved.
6. `src/test/java/.../WlHumanInTheLoopAppTest.java` — the deterministic assertions for both paths.
